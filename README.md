# BNP Kaggle Competition
We are trying to create the best data model for the BNP Kaggle competition.

To use the model, you need to download Anaconda flavor that meets your OS version from:

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

We are using python 3.5 for development. 

After that you need to download xgboost library and update all the libraries in your repo:

```
pip install xgboost
```

Then the following commands to update your libraries to the latest:

```
conda upgrade numpy scipy
```

To run the model, you need to go inside the scripts folder and run the following command:
```
python homesite_model.py
```
